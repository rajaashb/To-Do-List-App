🧠 How It Works

- Clicking "Add task" opens a small pop-up where you can type your task.

- After clicking "Add task" in the pop-up, the task appears in the list.

- Selecting a task and clicking "Delete selected task" removes it.

- Selecting a task and clicking "Mark as completed" adds a ✔ to it.

- Scrollbars help you view long lists or lengthy task content.
